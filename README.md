This project aimed to create a hyphenator of words, meaning, once a word is inserted, the algorithm reveals all syllables in the word, separated by a hyphen.
It was done as part of a research study on language comprehension with professor Vespignani in the CoLab, university of Padua.
The code was adapted to Italian text, but it can be edited accordingly for other languages.
